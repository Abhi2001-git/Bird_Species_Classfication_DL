# Bird_Species_Classfication_DL
This project leverages deep learning to classify bird species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy. The final model is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

# Bird Species Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify different bird species using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various bird species and predicts the species based on the input image. The classification is performed using deep learning techniques, likely involving a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of different bird species. Each image is labeled with its corresponding bird species to facilitate supervised learning.

## Model Training
- The dataset is preprocessed by resizing images and normalizing pixel values.
- A CNN-based model is trained to classify bird species.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the model.

## Results
- The model achieves high accuracy in classifying bird species.
- Performance evaluation metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand dataset with more bird species for better generalization.
